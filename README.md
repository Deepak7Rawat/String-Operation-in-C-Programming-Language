# String-Operation-in-C-Programming-Language
The project creates a complete Manual String Manipulation Toolkit which built using the C programming language. The project provides an effective educational tool which demonstrates low-level string processing because it does not use standard library functions such as strupr and strlwr and strrev but instead works with memory and ASCII values.

# 🧵 String Operations Project in C

A **menu-driven string manipulation project** developed in **C language**, focusing on **manual string processing without using built-in string functions** (except basic input/output support).

This project is ideal for understanding **core string logic**, **ASCII manipulation**, and **character-level operations**.

---

## 📖 Overview

The **String Operations Project** allows users to perform multiple operations on a single string through an interactive console menu.  
All operations are implemented **manually**, without relying on predefined string functions like `strupr()`, `strlwr()`, or `strrev()`.

---

## 🚀 Functionalities

The program supports the following string operations:

1. 🔠 Convert entire string to **Uppercase**
2. 🔡 Convert entire string to **Lowercase**
3. 🔄 Reverse the complete string
4. 🔁 Reverse each word at its own position
5. 🅰️ Convert **first letter of every word** to uppercase
6. 🅱️ Convert **last letter of every word** to uppercase
7. 🔢 Count **occurrence of each character**

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language:** C  
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Character arrays
  - ASCII value manipulation
  - Pointers
  - Loops and conditionals
  - Menu-driven programming
- **Header Files:**
  - `stdio.h`
  - `string.h`
  - `conio.h`

---

## 📋 Program Flow

1. User enters a string
2. Menu is displayed with multiple string operations
3. Selected operation is applied to the string
4. User can:
   - Continue with the same string
   - Enter a new string
   - Exit the program

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

- Manual implementation of string operations
- Understanding ASCII-based case conversion
- Working with pointers and arrays
- Efficient menu handling using recursion
- Logic building without built-in string utilities

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

***** Welcome to String Operation Project *****

Enter String -- hello world

1. Convert UpperCase Letter
2. Convert LowerCase Letter
3. Reverse String
4. Reverse Each Word on their Position
5. Convert First Letter of Each Word into Uppercase
6. Convert Last Letter of Each Word into Uppercase
7. Count Occurrence of Each Letter

🔤 Input String
hello world

1️⃣ Convert UpperCase Letter

Output:-
HELLO WORLD

2️⃣ Convert LowerCase Letter

Output:-
hello world

3️⃣ Reverse String

Output:-
dlrow olleh

4️⃣ Reverse Each Word on Their Position

Output:-
olleh dlrow

5️⃣ Convert First Letter of Each Word into Uppercase

Output:-
Hello World

6️⃣ Convert Last Letter of Each Word into Uppercase

Output:-
hellO worlD

7️⃣ Count Occurrence of Each Letter

Output:-
Occurrence of h is -- 1
Occurrence of e is -- 1
Occurrence of l is -- 3
Occurrence of o is -- 2
Occurrence of   is -- 1
Occurrence of w is -- 1
Occurrence of r is -- 1
Occurrence of d is -- 1
