# String-Operation-in-C-Programming-Language
The project creates a complete Manual String Manipulation Toolkit which built using the C programming language. The project provides an effective educational tool which demonstrates low-level string processing because it does not use standard library functions such as strupr and strlwr and strrev but instead works with memory and ASCII values.
